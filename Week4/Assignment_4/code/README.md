# Use of Code
The files to be sorted need ot be in the same file (directory) as the Sorts.py
and SortsDriver.py files for the code to run properly. 

The code was writen in python 3

The text file input_10000.txt was edited to change the delimeter between each
element to be space delimeted instead of '\n' delimeted to allow to use the
same parser for all files. The content of the file is the same and in the same
order.
